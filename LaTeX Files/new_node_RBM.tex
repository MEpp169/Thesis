\section{Unitary Operations and RBMs}
%
The state of an $N$-spin system is described by a wavefunction $\Psi(s)$ with
$s\in\{0,1\}^N$. $\Psi(s)$ can be encoded in a so-called Boltzmann Machine, a
simple two-layer ANN. It consists of $N_v$ visible and $N_h$ hidden nodes and
is specified by parameters $a\in\mathbb{R}^{N_v}, b\in\mathbb{R}^{N_h}$ and
$w\in\mathbb{R}^{N_h\times N_v}$. The energy function
\begin{equation}
    E(v,h) = v^Ta + h^Tb + h^Twv
\end{equation}
allows one to express probability distributions defined on $\mathbb{R}^{N_v}$
according to
\begin{equation}
    P(v) = \frac{\sum_{h}e^{-E(v,h)}}{\sum_v \sum_h e^{-E(v,h)}}.
\end{equation}
Similarly, if we allow complex $a\in\mathbb{C}^{N_v}, b\in\mathbb{C}^{N_h}$ and
$w\in\mathbb{C}^{N_h\times N_v}$ we can map each spin configuration
$s\in\{0,1\}^{N_S}$ of system with $N_S$ spins to a complex amplitude. This is
then the wavefunction
\begin{equation}
    \Psi(s) = \frac{\sum_{h}e^{-E(s,h)}}{\sum_s \sum_h e^{-E(s,h)}}.
    \label{eq:RBM-psi}
\end{equation}
Consider now a 1-body unitary operator $O\in U(2)$. It is completely specified
by its four matrix elements $O_{ss'}$ where $s,s'\in\{0,1\}$. Equivalently, we
can express this Operator in terms of an exponential function:
\begin{equation}
    O(s, s') = A \exp{(\alpha s + \beta s' +  \omega ss')}.
\end{equation}
To do this we simply associate
\begin{align*}
    A &= O_{00} \\
    \alpha &= \ln{\left(\frac{O_{10}}{A}\right)} \\
    \beta &= \ln{\left(\frac{O_{01}}{A}\right)} \\
    \omega &= \ln{\left(\frac{O_{11}}{A}\right)} - (\alpha + \beta).
\end{align*}
Clearly the function $O(s,s')$ defined this way behaves like the operator. The
wavefunction $\Psi'(s)$ after $O$ has acted upon the initial state $Psi(s)$ is
given by
\begin{align}
    \Psi'(s) &= \sum_{s'} O_{ss'} \Psi(s_1,\hdots, s', \hdots, s_N) \nonumber \\
             &= \sum_{s'} \exp{(\alpha s + \beta s' +  \omega ss')} \Psi(s_1,
                \hdots, s', \hdots, s_N)
\end{align}
Expressing the RHS wave-function now in terms of our RBM (cf. \ref{eq:RBM-psi}),
the sum over spin $s'$ can be associated with another hidden node.

\section{Unitary Operations and POVM Distributions}
Suppose now the RBM encodes some probability distribution $P(\vec{a})$ of an
informationally complete POVM measurement. This distribution then uniquely
specifies some quantum state. Let $O_{\vec{a},\vec{b}}$ now denote a single-body
unitary operator acting on POVM distribution vectors. Is it still possible to
rewrite this operator as an exponential function and describe the effect of the
unitary operation as the insertion of an additional node into the RBM? \par
Let us first consider the operator. The principal goal is to write it in
exponential form such that it can be absorbed into the energy functional of a
slightly modified architecture. There exist several ways of implementing POVMs
outcoms in an RBM. For reasons which will become apparent later we will choose
binary encoding. This means each outcome is encoded by pairs of two nodes in the
network. Binary nodes then lead to the configurations in \ref{tab:node_conf}
%
\begin{figure}[h!]
  \centering
  \begin{tabular}{c|c}
      POVM outcome & node configuration \\
      \hline
      1 & (0,0) \\
      2 & (0,1) \\
      3 & (1,0) \\
      4 & (1,1)
  \end{tabular}
  \caption{4-POVM outcomes implemented by binary nodes.}
  \label{tab:node_conf}
\end{figure}
%
A single-qubit gate in the POVM formalism corresponds to a complex
($4\times4$)-matrix. Its 16 entries need to be represented in their entirety in
the exponential representation of this operator. Rows in this matrix can be
associated with a fixed ''target outcome'' while entries in the same column
correspond to the same ''initial outcome''. Let us denote the two nodes encoding
the target outcome by $(v_1, v_2)$ and the nodes encoding the initial outcome
by $(h_1, h_2)$. The entry $O_{ij}$ corresponds to the transition element for
$j\rightarrow i$, where $i,j\in\{1,\hdots,4\}$ represent POVM measurements.
These states can also be described in terms of the nodes that encode them. Then
we have transitions $(h^j_1,h^j_2)\rightarrow(v^i_1,v^i_2)$. Each transition
(to which one specific matrix element is associated) can be represented by a
unique 4-tuple $(h^j_1,h^j_2, v^i_1,v^i_2)$ where each entry takes binary
values.  \par
Consider now products of these nodes. All possible products are given by
\begin{equation}
    \{ h_1^i h_2^j v_1^k v_2^l \: : \: (i,j,k,l)\in \{0,1\}^4 \}
\end{equation}
I will argue that the value of these variable-products can be used to identify
specific transitions. It is clear that $h_1h_2v_1v_2$ only evaluates to 1 if all
variables are equal to one. Hence this outcome can be used to identify the
($4\rightarrow4$) transition. We hence include this product in the exponent and
multiply it with a coefficient $\ln{(O_{44})}$ including some correction factors
which we will discuss later.
