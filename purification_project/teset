now apply quantum channel a second time -- see if it still works
Density matrix after channel (analytical):
[[0.5+0.00e+00j 0. -3.04e-18j]
 [0. +4.48e-18j 0.5+0.00e+00j]]
apply another unitary to whole system to realize channel
... done
density matrix after 2nd channel is (according to UBM update)
[[ 0.02+0.j   -0.02-0.08j]
 [-0.02+0.08j  0.98+0.j  ]]
Deviation between both density matrices after 2nd channel:
[[-0.48+0.j   -0.02-0.08j]
 [-0.02+0.08j  0.48+0.j  ]]
